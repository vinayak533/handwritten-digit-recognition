# Handwritten Digit Recognition using TensorFlow

This project builds a neural network to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset and TensorFlow/Keras.

## 📌 Project Description

The goal is to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels) into their corresponding numeric labels. The MNIST dataset is a standard benchmark in machine learning and computer vision.

This notebook demonstrates:
- Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset
- Building a deep learning model using TensorFlow
- Training and evaluating the model
- Visualizing predictions

## 💻 Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 🧠 Model Overview

The model uses a simple sequential neural network architecture:
- Flatten layer (converts 2D image to 1D vector)
- Dense layers with ReLU activation
- Output layer with Softmax (for classification)

## 📊 Results

The model achieves high accuracy on both training and test sets, demonstrating good generalization to unseen data.



The dataset is automatically downloaded via `tensorflow_datasets`.
